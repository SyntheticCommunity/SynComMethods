  abstract = {Metabolic interactions are fundamental to the assembly and functioning of microbiomes, including those of plants. However, disentangling the molecular basis of these interactions and their specific roles remains a major challenge. Here, we review recent applications of experimental and computational methods toward~the elucidation of metabolic interactions in plant-associated microbiomes. We highlight studies that span various scales of taxonomic and environmental complexity, including those that test interaction outcomes~in vitro and in planta by deconstructing microbial communities. We also discuss how the continued integration of multiple methods can further reveal the general ecological characteristics of plant microbiomes, as well as provide strategies for applications in areas such as improved plant protection, bioremediation, and sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract = {Direct observations of the complex and highly dynamic metabolic landscapes that affect the structure and functioning of bacterial communities in natural soil are limited by soil opacity and pore space complexity. In this study, we employ community metabolic network models to predict how the emerging bacterial community composition alters its structure and composition as a function of the primary carbon source in both well-mixed and spatially explicit systems. We provide systematic, experimental validation using a synthetic community comprised of four bacterial species grown on prescribed carbon sources and quantify their abundance using qPCR. Results suggest that community members may benefit from trophic interactions or suffer from increased competitive stress depending on the carbon source. The modeling is expanded to consider interactions in soil-like spatial context. Results show emergence of distinct bacterial community compositions as a function of primary carbon sources typical to soil hotspots (carbohydrates or organic acids). The ability to link genetic information with bacterial community trophic interactions in representative soil environments is a critical first step towards attaining predictability of soil ecological functioning.},
